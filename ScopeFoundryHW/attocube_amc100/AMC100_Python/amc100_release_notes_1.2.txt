AMC100 Firmware Release 1.2

IMPORTANT: This update only works from firmware version >1.1 If you come from an older version, see notes below. If you use the MOVE software, you have to update it.

rotation compensation feature: 
    The AMC Rotation Compensation Feature was added to the firmware. This additional feature allows the feedforward runout compensation of a rotator positioner. 
    If the feature is activated, the webinterface shows additional control options (please refer to the AMC Manual).
    com.attocube.amc.rotcomp.updateOffsets .setLUT, .getLUT, .setEnabled, .getEnabled, .getControlTargetRanges are new functions related to the Rotation Compensation Feature.
    Please note that this release does not include those functions as LabVIEW VIs yet. Though, they are available on request. Please contact attocube directly. 

bug fixes:
    - fixes a bug in the web interface which could lead to unusability if more then one browser window is opened.

performance and functionality updates:
    - increases the performance of the web interface significantly.
    - introduces a clearlier design for the navigation tab in the web interface which is similar to the MOVE application design.
    - introduces a possibility to set DNS resolvers and proxy server for future optional online features.
    - introduces a option to upload own key files and certificates for a secure access over HTTPS to the web interface.

changes:
    - Python/C API-Wrapper Libraries: for consistency improvement we changed the naming of many calls in this release. This is a breaking change.
      However, you can still use your old DLL/Python Version, as the backend functions did NOT change. You only have to use these newer libraries when you want to use the rotation compensation functions.
    - Old versions of the MOVE software will also not work with the new firmware version. Make sure to update it, too. The new MOVE software will not work with old firmware versions.
